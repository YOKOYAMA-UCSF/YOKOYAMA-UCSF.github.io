# Lab Culture {#lab-culture}

This chapter describes the structure and culture within the PALM Lab. The goal is to be clear about expectations for the members of the lab (ones that I have, as well as for each other) and importantly for myself.

> _This section aims to provide a picture of what mentoring and working with me will be like in the PALM Lab. It will continually be in-progress, shaped by (and including) feedback from lab members and others alike. -- William_
