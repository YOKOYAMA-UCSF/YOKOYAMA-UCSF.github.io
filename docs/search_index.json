Lab members will strive to uphold the following values: Integrity: Like many things in the world, science is built on trust and honesty. We will pursue rigorous and transparent research, ensuring our work is credible and reliable. Humility: By accepting that we may not decidedly know or understand everything, we are open to new perspectives. We are willing to admit we made mistakes and share what we have learned from them. Kindness: Science involves skepticism and criticism, but that does not mean it cannot be done with care and empathy. We hope to be respectful members of the scientific community, being considerate and supportive to our colleagues at all levels. Diversity: Science should reflect the vast perspectives, experiences and people that exist in the world. Our lab hopes to be inclusive to all, and promote equity throughout science. 2.5 Our Location "],["lab-culture.html", "Chapter 3 Lab Culture 3.1 Lab Environment 3.2 Work Expectations 3.3 Mentorship 3.4 Resolving Conflicts", " Chapter 3 Lab Culture This chapter describes the structure and culture within the PALM Lab. The goal is to be clear about expectations for the members of the lab (ones that I have, as well as for each other) and importantly for myself. This section aims to provide a picture of what mentoring and working with me will be like in the PALM Lab. It will continually be in-progress, shaped by (and including) feedback from lab members and others alike. – William 3.1 Lab Environment 3.2 Work Expectations 3.2.1 Time Off 3.2.2 Communication Expectations 3.3 Mentorship 3.4 Resolving Conflicts "],["research-policies.html", "Chapter 4 Research Policies 4.1 Academic Integrity 4.2 Authorship 4.3 Open Science", " Chapter 4 Research Policies 4.1 Academic Integrity 4.2 Authorship 4.3 Open Science 4.3.1 Sharing experiment code and data 4.3.2 Preprints and conference presentations "],["lab-resources.html", "Chapter 5 Lab Resources 5.1 Required Tools 5.2 Recommended 5.3 Optional", " Chapter 5 Lab Resources 5.1 Required Tools 5.2 Recommended 5.3 Optional "],["getting-started.html", "Chapter 6 Yokoyama Lab Onboarding 6.1 Before you Join 6.2 First Week Tasks 6.3 First Six Months", " Chapter 6 Yokoyama Lab Onboarding 6.1 Before you Join 6.2 First Week Tasks 6.3 First Six Months "],["miscellaneous.html", "Chapter 7 Miscellaneous 7.1 Collaborators 7.2 Additional resources", " Chapter 7 Miscellaneous 7.1 Collaborators 7.2 Additional resources "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
